[stem = oscilattor]
stem height: <OscilattorNode.frequency> (starting note/octave)
[petals = filter]
leaf type: 
leaf height: 

[petals = notes]
petal curve: filter  envelope 
petal height: filter  envelope  
petal width:  filter  envelope 
petal color: <OscilattorNode.type>[sine,square,sawtooth,triangle]
    - we use the 3 colors RGB to mix three wave types in the channels
        ex: purely blue would be square (00,00,255)
            aqua would be (00,100,255) a mix of square && sawtooth with full volume 
            square and some volume sawtooth (assuming green is sawtooth and blue is square)
petal count[]: note repitition


[head = note change/arp/scale]
head color: scale (need to be made up)
head pattern: arp
